## Rationale & Research Questions
**Primary Research Question:** Is there a relationship between sea turtle protection policies (light pollution ordinances) in Florida [cities? Counties?] and the amount of radiance those [cities? Counties?] output? 

**Additional Research Questions**

* How does radiance change before these light ordinances go into effect and after? I.e. how does radiance change with time?

* How does average radiance over time vary across cities/counties? 



**Rationale**
The state of Florida provided model lighting ordinance for local governments to develop their own light pollution policies largely to control beachfront lighting to protect hatching sea turtles. Policy implementation is important, but the radiance data can show if the policy has affected the amount of radiance in these Florida counties/municipalities. The amount or change in radiance, perhaps as a result of implementing the policy, is what will impact sea turtle protection.

*Rationale for Data*  

* The GoogleEarth Data Engine Catalog was chosen because it contains The Defense Meteorological Program (DMSP) Operational Line-Scan System (OLS), which has a unique capability to detect visible and near-infrared (VNIR) emission sources at night. And light pollution or radiance at night is what can negatively impact sea turtle hatchlings.

* The radiance data collected covers from 1992 â€“ 2013.

* For the purposes of this data analysis, we chose to only include counties/municipalities that adopted sea turtle protection ordinances between 1994 and 2011, to make sure that there is room for data before and after the policies took effect (buffers).

 
## Dataset Information

Even though this analysis focuses on average yearly data for radiance, we wanted to check quickly to see how it changes throughout the year. We found higher resolution data that pulled average monthly radiance for the years 2012 to 2020, and looked at Atlantic Beach. We saw that there is seasonality in the data, possibly relating to tourist season. We will still focus on yearly average, but it's good to know.

> As mapview also did not work for rmd, so we used ggplot to plot the difference of mean value of the light radiation before and after the implementation of the ordinance for different counties/locations. As shown above, the color denotes the difference between mean value of the light radiation before and after the implementation of the ordinance. Negative df means the light radiation decreased after the implementation of the ordiance and positve df means the light radiation increased after the implementation of the ordiance. The size of the circle represented the value of the mean light radiation before the implementation of the ordiance.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
